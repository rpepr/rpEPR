# rpEPR
Resolution enhancement and simulation of CW EPR spectra
This is a Fortran 90 program for resolution enhancement and simulation of 
EPR spectra. Also included are the supporting libraries, fftpack5, eispack and simplex_asa.

File				Description

fftpack5			A fortran fft library from NCAR
source				Fortran 90 EPR simulation programs
testdata			Sample EPR data used by rpEPR_test.sh
fort_deps_ctags.pl		Perl program to genrate Makefiles for the fortran
make_header			The top level targets and compiler flags are here
Makefiles			Generated by fort_deps_ctags.pl
rpEPR_test.sh			A script to test the simul program

The simulation programs in source were developed in the lab of George Reed at the
University of Wisconsin - Madison.

rpEPR implements a command drive interface to view and manipulate EPR spectra. It requires
gnuplot for display and printing.
